### Activity: Add some content to your blog
1. On the "Code" tab, select your `minima` branch
2. Click **Create new file**
3. Name the file `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`, but replace the `YYYY-MM-DD` with today's date, and `title` with the title you'd like to use for your first blog post
   
   * If your blog post date doesn't follow the correct date convention, you'll receive an error and your site won't build. For more information, see "[Page build failed: Invalid post date](https://help.github.com/articles/page-build-failed-invalid-post-date/)".
4. Type a quick draft of your blog post. Remember, you can always edit it later
5. Commit your changes to your branch
